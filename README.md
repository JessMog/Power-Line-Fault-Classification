# Power-Line-Fault-Classification
Supervised Machine Learning Techniques and Artificial Neural Networks
## Overview
The main objective of this project is to detect and classify the faults on electrical power transmission lines using different supervised machine learning techniques and artificial neural networks. 
The three phase currents and voltages of one end are taken as inputs in the proposed scheme. Feed forward neural networks along with back propagation algorithms will be utilized for detection and classification of the fault for analysis of each of the three phases involved in the process.

We intend to conduct a detailed analysis using various supervised models such as SVM, decision trees,KNN, regression models, naive bayes and neural networks. From this analysis, we will acquire relevant insights that can be used to predict future outcomes on the performance of power transmission lines.
